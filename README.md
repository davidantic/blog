If you're using a Linux distribution like Ubuntu, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

  1. Create a new virtual environment named "myenv": python3 -m venv myenv
  2. Activate the virtual environment:source myenv/bin/activate
  3. Once the virtual environment is activated, install crispy forms: pip install django-crispy-forms
